# Installation Guide for Subaru's March 2023 Infotainment Update

1. Make sure your vehicle is parked in an area that can safely have its engine on for at least 1.5 hours 
2. Read Subaru's documentation on the update installation and change documentation.
3. Review user experience on the new update such as on Subaru forums and subreddits. 
4. Determine whether the update is mandatory or optional in terms of system stability, security, and general changes.
5. Acknowledge the projected downtime and allot double the amount of time.
6. Document your car's current software version and model/trim/year.
7. Match your current software version to the software documentation's table, which is broken down into multiple rows designated for each model/trim/year for which this update applies. This will verify which software update version you should download.

11. Review the files on the Google shared drive and user experience regarding the installation of and stability of the infotainment update with files from this exact location.
12. Download the appropriate files for your vehicle.
13. Insert the USB drive in your vehicle and make sure no other USB device is connected.
14. Enter dealership mode, select 'software update', then document the next window which shows the current version numbers of the three major components of the infotainment system, as well as the versions on the update files.
15. As a redundancy, regardless of the initial match, match each of those version numbers to a second table provided by the update documentation, which is broken down by component, old version numbers, and version number of the update file.

20. Review each change made by this update and confirm, if possible (apart from patched bugs and glitches), that the changes were actually made and the system is stable.
21. Enjoy your updated infotainment system and drive with confidence.
